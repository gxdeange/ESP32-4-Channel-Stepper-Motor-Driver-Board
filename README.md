# ESP32 4-Channel Stepper Motor Driver Board 24V MAX

Low current (~800mA) 4 channel Stepper Motor Driver Board that allows an ESP32 Dev kit (38 Pin) module to plug on top

This 4 channel stepper motor driver board is the same size as the ESP32 Dev Kit (38 Pin) module and is capable of running at 24V MAX.

Features include:
* Reverse Polarity protection
* 12 GPIO Pads (4 Pads include R/C Input filter) that allow direct soldering of wiring or 3 X 4 Dupont Header pins
* Micro Step set to 1/8 (cannot be changed)
* Adjustable current output (Max 800mA Peak)
* Use of Texas Instruments DRV8428 Driver IC's
* Suitable for small Stepper Motors only
* Driver Board powers ESP32 Module (for wireless connectivity)
**RC Filtered Inputs**
* GPIO39
* GPIO34
* GPIO17
* GPIO35
