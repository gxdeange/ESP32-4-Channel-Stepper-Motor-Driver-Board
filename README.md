# ESP32 4-Channel Stepper Motor Driver Board 24V MAX

Low current (~800mA) 4 channel Stepper Motor Driver Board that allows an ESP32 Dev kit (38 Pin) module to plug on top

This 4 channel stepper motor driver board is the same size as the ESP32 Dev Kit (38 Pin) module and is capable of running at 24V MAX.

Features include:
* Reverse Polarity protection
* 12 GPIO Pads (4 Pads include R/C Input filter) that allow direct soldering of wiring or 3 X 4 Dupont Header pins
* Micro Step set to 1/8 (cannot be changed)
* Adjustable current output (Max 800mA Peak)
* Use of Texas Instruments DRV8428 Driver IC's
* Suitable for small Stepper Motors only
* Driver Board powers ESP32 Module (for wireless connectivity)
* **RC Filtered Inputs**
* GPIO39
* GPIO34
* GPIO17
* GPIO35

# ESP32 4-Channel Stepper Motor Driver Board 10V MAX

**These versions have the same 8 GPIO's with RC Filtered Inputs (can also be used as outputs) and are limited to 10V MAX with approximately 600mA or 300mA (Max) Current output (Trinamic TMC2300 Driver IC's). These are ideal for battery powered projects or projects with small low current motors**
